# About

Hey, I’m **Hirunkul Phimsiri** (or just **Guide**).

I’m a developer who loves working on AI and full-stack projects. I build things like chatbots, RAG systems, websites, and backend stuff. Most of the time, I’m either coding, fixing something I broke, or trying out new tools I probably don’t need. I also enjoy working with cloud platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, and ~Azure~, and I run a homelab just for fun (and pain).

This site is where I share the stuff I’m working on, random thoughts, and probably a few anime references.

## Random Projects

::github{repo="hrnph/AIwaifu"}

- The name suggests it’s an AI Waifu :D

::github{repo="hrnph/GANime-FullBody"}

- Image generation model for full-body anime characters using GANs.
- From the era where's diffusion models and midjourney were not a thing.

::github{repo="PyThaiNLP/pythainlp"}

- Contibuted to PythaiNLP/Khavee I helped develop Khavee (กวี), the opensource python Thai poetry and literature analysis toolkit features in PythaiNLP.

## Other Things About Me

- I’m studying Computer Engineering at Chulalongkorn University.
- I enjoy anime, especially when I can mix it with tech (you’ll probably see that here).
- I like DevOps and infra work, even when it breaks.
- I contribute to some Thai NLP tools too.

## Experience - (Boring stuff for recruiters)

This site is just my space to log things I’ve done, thoughts I want to keep, and stuff I find cool. Thanks for visiting.

I wanted it to feel cozy, so I used [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari)—a nice little blog template that matches my taste.
